### Project Overview
This Python project focuses on audio signal processing and visualization. It involves reading a piano note sound file, analyzing it using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and visualizing its frequency spectrum. The project demonstrates key concepts in digital signal processing such as sampling, frequency domain analysis, and magnitude spectrum representation.

### Setting Up and Executing the Script
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Libraries: `scipy`, `numpy`, `sounddevice`, `matplotlib`. Install them using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install scipy numpy sounddevice matplotlib
  ```

#### Running the Script
1. Place your audio file (e.g., `pianonote.wav`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python audio_analysis.py
   ```

### Key Features
- Reads audio data from a `.wav` file.
- Converts audio samples to a normalized float32 format.
- Applies FFT to convert the time-domain signal to a frequency-domain representation.
- Visualizes the magnitude spectrum in decibels (dB) over a specified frequency range.
- Highlights the fundamental frequencies of a standard piano note for analysis.

### Notes
- The script is configured for `.wav` files. For other formats, additional libraries or conversion may be necessary.
- The visualization is set for a frequency range of Â±1000 Hz. Modify this range in the code for different analyses.
- Ensure the sampling rate of the audio file matches the script's expectations for accurate results.

### Potential Enhancements
- Implement a user interface for selecting and analyzing different audio files.
- Include features for audio filtering and effects.
- Expand the project to analyze more complex sounds or music pieces.
- Add functionality to save the generated plots as image files.
